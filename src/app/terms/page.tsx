        In order to use the services, user must be 18 years of age or older.
        Additionally, user must be eligible to enter into a legally binding
        agreement with our company.
        <br />

        It is the sole responsibility of the user to confirm whether it is legal
        for the user to use this service, and our company assumes no
        responsibility for user’s behavior.
        <br />
        <br />
        By accepting the Terms of Use, user fully understands that there is a
        risk of losing money when trading, and they shall be fully responsible
        for any and all losses.
        <br />
        <br />
        The computer software, algorithms, graphics, website, and the user
        interface that are provided to the user are owned by our company and
        protected by copyright law.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Account</strong>
        <br />
        The registration of accounts is limited to one per person, enforced by
        the limitation of registration by device and/or IP address.
        <br />
        It is prohibited to use the services under multiple accounts. If we
        discover that user is operating multiple accounts, we reserve the right
        to suspend all accounts operated by user and to confiscate all funds.
        <br />
        Users cannot transfer or sell accounts to a third party.
        <br />
        Our company, in its sole discretion, may refuse to open a user’s account
        or may close the account. We also reserve the right to withhold payment
        of your winnings.
        <br />
        The name registered when opening an account must be the same as the name
        printed on the user’s government-issued ID card.
        <br />
        Our company is not responsible for any unauthorized access by third
        parties to user’s accounts. It is the responsibility of the user to
        maintain the security of their account password and credentials and any
        losses occurring through compromised passwords are under no
        circumstances the responsibility of our company.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Account Suspension</strong>
        <br />
        Our company reserves the right to suspend the user’s account after one
        year has elapsed since the last time the user has accessed the account.
        <br />
        During suspension, a monthly account maintenance fee will be levied in
        the amount of USD 15 per month. Upon logging in during this period, the
        suspension will be lifted and no additional maintenance fees will be
        levied unless the account once again becomes suspended.
        <br />
        In the event that the account reaches a zero balance owing to
        maintenance fees during the suspension period, no additional fees will
        be levied. However, we reserve the right to close your account if there
        is no activity nor money deposited for three months.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Deposits</strong>
        <br />
        The currency of EveryX is USDT, but several currencies are available for
        deposit through supported payment methods, such as cryptocurrency,
        credit card, or bank transfer. All non-USDT deposited currencies will be
        credited in their USDT equivalent as determined by Payment Provider.
        <br />
        Fees may or may not be incurred depending on the payment method for
        deposits. Please check the details when making a deposit.
        <br />
        If deposits are made using fraudulent or illicitly gained credentials,
        user’s account will be subject to closure and assets will be
        confiscated.
        <br />
        Additional procedures to verify the identity of users may be implemented
        at any time before allowing deposits via certain methods.
        <br />
        The minimum deposit is USDT $10.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Withdrawals</strong>
        <br />
        Withdrawals will only be permitted if the total funds wagered equals or
        exceeds the funds deposited.
        <br />
        Additional procedures to verify the identity of users may be implemented
        at any time before allowing withdrawals via certain methods.
        <br />
        The minimum withdrawal is USDT $10 and the maximum is USDT $10,000. This
        maximum may be lower for certain payment methods.

        method, except if depositing using cryptocurrencies.
        <br />
        The name registered on your account must match the name on the
        withdrawal destination, otherwise Payment Provider may not process your
        withdrawal request.
        <br />
        We are not responsible for any losses due to user error or omission when
        inputting withdrawal information.

        achieved before expiration, the bonus and any profits earned from the
        bonus will be forfeit.
        <br />

        user makes a withdrawal before the terms and conditions of the bonus or
        promotion have been fulfilled.
        <br />
        For deposit bonuses, the deposit is used first, then the bonus amount.
        <br />
        We reserve the right to immediately suspend or cancel any and all
        promotions in the event of suspected abuse or fraudulent activity.
        <br />
